Cognitive Speed
Research purpose
We tested your cognitive processing speed in two different ways. In one test, you had to press a button when a green box with the word "GO" appeared. This was a test of how quickly you can respond to simple changes. In a second test, you had to correctly match pairs of shapes and numbers. This tested your processing speed and short-term memory. Finally, we asked you to identify synonyms of different words. This tested your long-term memory for words. We are interested in how these different types of cognitive processing relate to each other and how they change as we get older.

Understanding results
There are some limitations you should keep in mind as you look at your feedback. Each of these experiments represents an area of active research - until we have gathered many results from people like you, we can't conclude anything about what volunteers' results mean. Furthermore, these kinds of results are only meaningful at the group level - that is, they may reflect patterns that apply on average and not necessarily to any one person. For example, let's say we decided to do a study examining gender and hair length. We might find that, on average, women have longer hair than men. However, having long hair doesn't make you female and being female doesn't give you long hair. In other words, females have longer hair on average, but this logic cannot be applied to individuals.

If you are surprised by your results on any of these tests, you shouldn't be concerned. There are many reasons why scores on this task might differ. For instance, differences in computer systems or distractions while doing the task can affect results. This task was not designed to specifically assess you, and the scores can vary widely among the people who complete it.

Response Speed Test
In this test, you had to respond as quickly as possible to images on your screen. Your score is your speed or how fast you were able to respond. Higher scores indicate faster responses.

Your score was 23.43. The average score is 32.895.
VISUALIZATION

You scored higher than zero out of every ten people who took this test:

Matching Shapes and Numbers
In this test, you were asked to correctly match pairs of shapes and numbers. Your score indicates how many pairs you were able to match in 90 seconds. This was a test of your processing speed.

Your score was 60. The average score is 52.
VISUALIZATION

You scored higher than seven out of every ten people who took this test:
VISUALIZATION

Vocabulary III
In this test, you decided which of the five words was closest in meaning to another word. This was a test of your vocabulary or verbal knowledge. Your score is the number of words you correctly defined, out of 30.

Your score was 27. The average score is 24.
VISUALIZATION

You scored higher than eight out of every ten people who took this test:
