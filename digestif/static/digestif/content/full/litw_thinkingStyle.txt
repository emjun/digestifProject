<p>Based on your results, your thinking style appears to be <strong>strongly intuitive.</strong> When tackling a problem, you may tend to look at the bigger picture and examine functional relationships.</p>
<br>
<h2>How did we determine your result?</h2>
<p>This test measured your thinking style. Its based on two previous studies that found cultural differences in the way people group information [1,2] (see references below).
<br /><br />First, we tested whether you prefer to group words by their analytic category or by their holistic function, as below:
<p><strong>Analytic combination</strong>
<br>IMAGE<br>
Seagull and dog both belong to the same abstract category: animals.</p>
<p><strong>Holistic combination</strong>
<br>IMAGE<br>
Seagull and sky, however, are grouped together by their function: seagulls fly in the sky.</p>
 <br>
 <p>We also measured whether you judge similarities based on a single specific feature, or whether you judge similarities based on a set of broader, thematic features, as below:</p>
 <p><strong>Specific feature</strong>
 <br>IMAGE<br>
 In this set of images, the larger flower shares a specific feature (a curved stem) with all flowers in the group.</p>
 <p><strong>Thematic features</strong>
 <br>IMAGE<br>
 In this set of images, the larger flower shares several features (pointed petals, a leafless stem, an orange center) with three of the four flowers in the group, but does not share any one feature with all of the flowers in the group.</p>
