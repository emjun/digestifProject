Openness
Openness to experience describes a dimension of personality that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.
This trait refers to the extent to which people prefer novelty versus convention. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who dislikes needless complexity, and prefers the familiar over the unusual. You might say that you are more conservative than many, but not to an extreme level, and that you value practical outcomes over flighty imagination.
Reflective question: How do you respond to people who have lots of new ideas?

Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.
This trait refers to the extent to which people prefer an organised, or a flexible, approach in life. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is spontaneous and fun, and that you like to do unexpected things that make life that bit more interesting. You might say that you aren't completely unreliable, but you've been known to slip up on occasion.
Reflective question: How do you go about tackling a new task?

Extraversion
Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world, versus being comfortable with your company.
This trait refers to the extent to which you enjoy company, and seek excitement and stimulation. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who enjoys and actively seeks out social occasions, but would say that they're not everything. You might say that sometimes it is nice to step back for a while and have a quiet night in.
Reflective question: What role do you tend to play in a team? (at work or in social activities)

Agreeableness
Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony.
This trait refers to the way people express their opinions and manage relationships. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is willing to make difficult decisions when necessary, and will point out when something is wrong no matter what other people might feel. Your responses suggest that you would say that you can be tough and uncompromising.
Reflective question: When others are experiencing problems, what do you do?

Neuroticism
Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative emotions.
This trait refers to the way people cope with, and respond to, life's demands. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who tends to be more self-conscious than many.

Reflective question: When do you not feel in control of your emotions?
