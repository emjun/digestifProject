<p>The Reading the Mind in The Eyes Test measures the cognitive component of empathy. This component is also referred to as "Theory of Mind", Mind-Reading, or mentalization. Cognitive empathy is the ability to predict what another person is thinking or feeling, remote from the emotional reaction to it. Females typically scores higher on this test than males. People on the autism spectrum tend to score low on this measure but their emotional reactivity component (affective empathy) typically remains intact.</p>

<p>Our previous research has found that preferences for certain musical styles and attributes are linked to empathy levels. Here we wanted to see if listening to certain types of music might actually increase scores on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. You were randomly presented with one of ten different pieces of music or sounds. We hope this research will help identify the types of music that increase empathy the most.</p>
