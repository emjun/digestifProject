<h1>Color Names</h1>
<p>Thank you for naming colors for us! Those names are not part of your color perception score. Instead, we will use them as part of a research study on how colors are named in different languages, which is why we could not give you examples color names or hints.</p>
<p>If you would like to see the results from the color naming task, enter your email below and we will email you when the study is finished. Your email address will be kept separately from the data you entered.</p>
