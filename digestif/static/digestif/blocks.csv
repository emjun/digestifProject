From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who dislikes needless complexity, and prefers the familiar over the unusual. You might say that you are more conservative than many, but not to an extreme level, and that you value practical outcomes over flighty imagination.</p><p>Reflective question: <i>How do you respond to people who have lots of new ideas?</i></p><br><h2>Conscientiousness</h2><p>Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.</p><p>This trait refers to the extent to which people prefer an organised, or a flexible, approach in life. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is spontaneous and fun, and that you like to do unexpected things that make life that bit more interesting. You might say that you arent completely unreliable, but youve been known to slip up on occasion.</p><p>Reflective question: <i>How do you go about tackling a new task?</i></p><br><h2>Extraversion</h2><p>Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world, versus being comfortable with your company.</p><p>This trait refers to the extent to which you enjoy company, and seek excitement and stimulation. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who enjoys and actively seeks out social occasions, but would say that theyre not everything. You might say that sometimes it is nice to step back for a while and have a quiet night in.</p><p>Reflective question: <i>What role do you tend to play in a team? (at work or in social activities)</i></p><br><h2>Agreeableness</h2><p>Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony.</p><p>This trait refers to the way people express their opinions and manage relationships. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is willing to make difficult decisions when necessary, and will point out when something is wrong no matter what other people might feel. Your responses suggest that you would say that you can be tough and uncompromising.</p><p>Reflective question: <i>When others are experiencing problems, what do you do?</i></p><br><h2>Neuroticism</h2><p>Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative emotions.</p><p>This trait refers to the way people cope with, and respond to, lifes demands. From the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who tends to be more self-conscious than many. Based on your responses, you come across as someone who can find it hard to not get caught up by anxious or stressful situations. You might say that you are in touch with your own feelings.</p><p>Reflective question: <i>When do you not feel in control of your emotions?</i></p>

msb_emotion|acknowledgments|acknowledgments/msb_emotion.png|<p>Thank you for participating in this study!</p>
msb_emotion|research_motivations|research_motivations/msb_emotion.png|<h2>WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?</h2><p>The purpose of this study was to measure peoples implicit beliefs about how long various emotions and other mental states last. We were interested in both how long you thought each emotion lasts on average, and what type of statistical distribution best reflects your responses. We were also interested in determining whether peoples beliefs about emotions are associated with other social-cognitive traits, a question we could assess if you completed this and other studies on the site while logged in to an account.</p><h2>WHAT WERE OUR HYPOTHESES?</h2><p>We hypothesized that people reason about the durations of emotions in an approximately Bayesian (LINK) way. In particular we assumed that you made educated guesses in the experiment by combining your prior knowledge of how long emotions last with the evidence provided (how long an emotion has lasted so far) to make a rational inference about its likely total duration. Using this assumption, we could reverse-engineer your beliefs about the durations of emotions, and determine how these differed between different mental states. We hypothesized that these beliefs might be associated with other social cognitive traits such as emotional stability, with high stability individuals thinking that states las for longer than low stability individuals.</p>
msb_emotion|experimental_design|experimental_design/msb_emotion.png|<h2>HOW WAS THIS STUDY CONDUCTED?</h2><p>On each trial of the task, we provided you with the name of some emotion or mental state, such as "happiness." We also told you how long a certain person had been experiencing that state so far. We then asked you to guess how long that state would last in total (including the time elapsed). We could correlate the duration-to-date that we provided you with how much longer you thought the state would last. This allows us to determine which of three types of statistical distribution your responses reflect.<br>VISUALIZATION<br>As you can see in the image above, different statistical distributions imply different prediction rules. If you think that emotion durations follow a power law (LINK) distribution - that is, with many very short emotional experiences, but a handful of extremely long ones - then you likely used a multiplicative rule to determine your responses (not necessarily consciously). Under this rule, your guesses would be some constant multiple of the durations-to-date that we provided you. In contrast, your responses might have come from a distribution like the Erlang (LINK), which has fewer very short states relative to a power law but still has many long emotion experiences. Erlang distributions are known as "memory-less" because how long one has been in a state does not relate to how much longer it will last (unlike a power law, where the longer a state has gone on, the longer it is likely to go). Thus the appropriate predication rule for Erlang distributions is to add a constant value to the durations we provided you. Finally, your implicit beliefs about emotions could reflect a normal-distribution of durations. Normal or Gaussian (LINK) distributions have a mean value around which their statistical "mass" is distributed. Thus both very long and very short values are unlikely to occur. The Bayesian prediction rule for a normal distribution is to guess the mean (or average) until that value is almost reached, and then guess a number increasingly smaller than the current value.</p><h2>DID WE TELL YOU EVERYTHING?</h2><p>We never lie to participants on MySocialBrain.org: active deception is not a part of our any of our research. However, in some studies we make use of "incomplete disclosure" - meaning that we do not tell you about some aspects of a study in advance. Typically this takes the form of not disclosing our experimental manipulation or research hypotheses. We do this primarily to avoid biasing your responses with demand characteristics (LINK). In the case of the current study, we did not provideyou with the detailed description of distributions and prediction rules beforehand because we wanted to respond intuitively rather than consciously selecting one of these rules to follow. We also did not emphasize that were interested in differences between states, as well as between participants.</p>...<h2>WHAT DO MY RESULTS MEAN?</h2><p>The results below reflect our best guess about your beliefs regarding the durations of emotions. To simplify calculations for the web browser, we use a rule of thumb to determine which of the three distributions described above your responses most likely come from. This approach is not perfect, especially with only 20 trials, so there is a chance our that classification is mistaken and/or that you will get a different response if you participate in this experiment again.The donut chart reflects the results of other people who previously participated in this experiment, and is provided to contextualize how common your results. Receiving a more or less common result is not necessarily a good or bad thing, since the common belief may or may not be accurate or useful.</p>
msb_emotion|research_goals|research_goals/msb_emotion.png|<h2>WHY IS THIS STUDY IMPORTANT?</h2><p>Peoples beliefs about emotions guide many decisions about themselves and others. For example, if someone believes that sadness regret is an inherently brief feeling, they may be more likely to engage in activities which are likely to cause them to feel regret. Similarly, if people believe that hate is a long lasting emotion, they may be hesitant to risk eliciting it from others. As yet relatively little work has characterized what people believe about specific emotions. While some research has elicited explicit judgments, these may be biased for a number of reasons, thus making it important to look for convergent evidence for a partially implicit measure such as this one. Furthermore, we aim to characterize not just the mean duration that people think different emotions last, but what statistical distribution of durations they think reflects each state.</p>...<p>IMAGE</p><h2>THE MIND ON THE WEB</h2><p>We use large scale web research to complement the fine-grained work we do with fMRI. MySocialBrain.org (LINK) is a platform for wide variety of social cognitive experiments. It allows us to study much larger and more diverse groups of people than we would otherwise be able to. From the participants point of view, it offers engaging, interactive experiments with personalized feedback to a broad audience.</p><p>IMAGE</p><h2>INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL ABILITIES</h2><p>One of the major goals of this site has less to do with any one study than with the correlations of multiple studies. Research on "individual differences" - the psychological properties that make people different from one another, such as personality or intelligence - requires very large sample sizes for meaningful results. Thats where our account system comes in. By registering (LINK), you allow us to correlate your (deidentified) data across studies, and thereby answer exciting new questions.</p>
msb_emotion|personalized_results|personalized_results/msb_emotion.png|<strong>Your prediction rule: Erlang/additive</strong><p>Your responses in the experiment suggest that you implicitly believe that emotions follow an Erlang distribution. This means that how long an emotion has gone on so far is unrelated to how long it will last. Thus, whether a mental state has lasted for 1 hour or 10 hours, you will predict that the remaining duration of the state is about the same. In general, you probably think that there are few extremely short emotional states and some very long emotional experiences.</p><strong>Others results:</strong><br>VISUALIZATION

msb_writing|research_motivations|research_motivations/msb_writing.png|<h2>WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?</h2><p>The purpose of this study was to enable research on the links between writing style and social cognition. Specifically, we are interested in whether aspects of the way people write, such as use of personal pronouns, reliably predicts aspects of the way people think about others minds. Secondarily, we are also interested in whether and how writing styles differ between different genres.</p><h2>WHAT WERE OUR HYPOTHESES?</h2><p>We hope to learn how people with different writing styles perform on other social cognitive tasks. For example, research suggests that some people try to use bigger words to appear intelligence. However, this strategy has the ironic effect (LINK) or actually lowering others estimates of the writers intelligence. This effect can be thought of as a social prediction error, and thus we might expect that people with more complex writing actually make more mistakes on other social task. Participants who took part in this study and others on this site allow us to test for the presence of such correlations.</p>
msb_writing|experimental_design|experimental_design/msb_writing.png|<h2>HOW WAS THIS STUDY CONDUCTED?</h2><p>We first counted the total number of characters in your text sample, then broke up the sample into words and sentences and counted these as well. In addition to these aggregate counts, we also measured how many times the sample contained particular "stop words (LINK)" - grammatical words with little or no content. Finally, we counted the use of different punctuation marks throughout the sample. Previously we applied the same analysis to the works of a number of famous writers, allowing us to correlate your results with their and thereby measure their similarity to your style.</p><h2>DID WE TELL YOU EVERYTHING?</h2><p>We never lie to participants on MySocialBrain.org: active deception is not a part of our any of our research. However, in some studies we make use of "incomplete disclosure" - meaning that we do not tell you about some aspects of a study in advance. Typically this takes the form of not disclosing our experimental manipulation or research hypotheses. We do this primarily to avoid biasing your responses with demand characteristics (LINK). In the case of the "Who do you write like" study, there was no experimental manipulation and our hypothesis was general - we predicted that the survey results might correlated with some other measures of social cognition.</p>...<h2>WHAT DO MY RESULTS MEAN?</h2><p>Below you may see the result of your stylistic analysis of your text sample. The horizontal bars indicate the similarity of your style with those of the famous authors listed. Higher values (bars further right) indicate larger greater similarity between your style and theirs. Note that some of this similarity is likely due to incidental factors such as the genre of the writing and the recency of the authors work. For example, Lewis Clark (LINK), in addition to writing Alice in Wonderland, was also a mathematician. His numerous academic text - featuring much formal notation - are included in his stylistic profile. Thus he consistently ends up as one of the least similar writers in the bunch. The writers in the list were selected to be both famous and prolific, with the latter helping to ensure that their style could be precisely estimated. However, you may note that most of them wrote more than half a century ago. This is because to measure their textual similarity we used text from Project Gutenberg (LINK), an organization devoted to digitizing public domain books and providing them free to the public. Since the vast majority of the books available from Project Gutenberg are in the public domain, relatively few recent writers are included. You can click on the names of any of the writers below to view their words on Project Gutenberg.</p>
msb_writing|research_goals|research_goals/msb_writing.png|<h2>WHY IS THIS STUDY IMPORTANT?</h2><p>Measuring peoples psychological traits and social abilities can be time-consuming and effortful for both the participant and the researcher. By identifying correlations between such measures and aspects of writing style, we hope to be able to build algorithms that can automatically infer participants abilities from their writing. This would make it much easier to measure peoples traits and abilities since participants could simply provide a writing sample rather than engage in hours of survey and tasks. We hope this this will ultimately benefit both individuals who participate in research and the research itself.</p>...<p>IMAGE</p><h2>THE MIND ON THE WEB</h2><p>We use large scale web research to complement the fine-grained work we do with fMRI. MySocialBrain.org (LINK) is a platform for wide variety of social cognitive experiments. It allows us to study much larger and more diverse groups of people than we would otherwise be able to. From the participants point of view, it offers engaging, interactive experiments with personalized feedback to a broad audience.</p><p>IMAGE</p><h2>INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL ABILITIES</h2><p>One of the major goals of this site has less to do with any one study than with the correlations of multiple studies. Research on "individual differences" - the psychological properties that make people different from one another, such as personality or intelligence - requires very large sample sizes for meaningful results. Thats where our account system comes in. By registering (LINK), you allow us to correlate your (deidentified) data across studies, and thereby answer exciting new questions.</p>

mu_brainType|personalized_results|personalized_results/mu_brainType.png|<h1>EMPATHY</h1><p>Your score on the Empathy Quotient (EQ) test is: 25</p><br><p>How does your score compare to the general population? See the table below. Simply compare your score to the categories below. Because females do score higher than males, we have also included the averages based on gender.</p><p>TABLE</p><br><p>Empathy is a very important aspect of daily life. It enables people to tune into how others are feeling, and to understanding what they may be thinking. It allows people to predict peoples behavior, react appropriately to others, and to interact effectively in social settings. From the onset of infancy, children begin to display empathetic behavior, and as they grow into early childhood they develop what is termed "theory of mind". Theory of Mind, or "mind-reading" is the ability to place your own feelings aside, and to attribute and infer a mental state of another based on their experience. Whereas Theory of Mind has to do with the cognitive component of empathy, there is an affective component as well which has to do with your ability to emotionally respond appropriately to the affect state of another. The Empathy Quotient (EQ) is a test that measures both the affective and cognitive components of empathy. In general, females score higher than males on EQ, and some evidence suggests that EQ increases with age.</p><br><h1>SYSTEMIZING</h1><p>Your score on the Systemizing Quotient (SQ) test is: 20</p><p>How does your score compare to the general population?

Systemizing is a very important aspect of everyday life. It helps us to navigate, make sense of, and understand our external world. The Systemizing Quotient (SQ) test measures the ability to systemize for a wide range of systems including mechanical(e.g., machines), abstract(e.g., mathematics), and organizable(e.g., taxonomy) systems. In general, males score higher on the SQ than females.</p>

mu_eyes|experimental_design|experimental_design/mu_eyes.png|<p>The Reading the Mind in The Eyes Test measures the cognitive component of empathy. This component is also referred to as "Theory of Mind", Mind-Reading, or mentalization. Cognitive empathy is the ability to predict what another person is thinking or feeling, remote from the emotional reaction to it. Females typically scores higher on this test than males. People on the autism spectrum tend to score low on this measure but their emotional reactivity component (affective empathy) typically remains intact.</p>...<p>You were randomly presented with one of ten different pieces of music or sounds.</p>

pi_genderCareer|personalized_results|personalized_results/pi_genderCareer.png|<h2>Your result:</h2><p><strong>Your data suggest little or no automatic association between Female and Male with Career and Family..</strong></p><br>...<h2>Other Peoples Results</h2><p>The summary of other peoples results shows that most people implicitly associate male with career - i.e., they are faster sorting when career words and male words go with the same key. Notably, about a third of the people included in this graph resort associating the two groups equally with the concepts of career and family.</p><p>VISUALIZATION</p>
pi_genderCareer|experimental_design|experimental_design/pi_genderCareer.png|<p>The sorting test you just took is called the Implicit Association Test (IAT). You categorized Female and Male names and words related to Career and Family.</p><h2>Disclaimer:</h2> <p>The results are not a definitive assessment of your implicit preference. The results may be influenced by variables related to the test (e.g., the category labels or particular items used to represent the categories on the IAT) or the person (e.g., how tired you are). The results are provided for educational prurposes only.</p><h2>How Does The IAT Work?</h2><p>The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., Female/Male and Career/Family). The main idea is that making a response is easier when closely related items share the same response key. We would say that one has an implicit association between Male and Career relative to Female and Career if they are faster to categorize words when Male and Career share a response key relative to when Female and Career share a response key.</p>...<h2>What About Order Effects?</h2><p>One very common question is about the order of the parts of the IAT. The answer is yes, the order in which you take the test can influence on your overall results. But, the effect is very small. So if you first pair Career + Male and then pair Career + Female, your results might show a tiny bit more of an association with Male and Career than they would have if you had done the reverse pairing first. One way that we try to minimize this order effect is by giving more practice trials before the second pairing than we did before the first pairing. It is also important to know that each participant is randomly assigned to an order, so half of test-takers complete Career + Male and then Career + Female, and the other half of the test-takers get the opposite order.</p>

tmb_cognitiveSpeed|research_motivations|research_motivations/tmb_cognitiveSpeed.png|<h2>Research purpose</h2><p>We tested your cognitive processing speed in two different ways. In one test, you had to press a button when a green box with the word "GO" appeared. This was a test of how quickly you can respond to simple changes. In a second test, you had to correctly match pairs of shapes and numbers. This tested your processing speed and short-term memory. Finally, we asked you to identify synonyms of different words. This tested your long-term memory for words. We are interested in how these different types of cognitive processing relate to each other and how they change as we get older.</p>
tmb_cognitiveSpeed|experimental_design|experimental_design/tmb_cognitiveSpeed.png|<h2>Understanding results</h2><p>There are some limitations you should keep in mind as you look at your feedback. Each of these experiments represents an area of active research - until we have gathered many results from people like you, we cant conclude anything about what volunteers results mean. Furthermore, these kinds of results are only meaningful at the group level - that is, they may reflect patterns that apply on average and not necessarily to any one person. For example, lets say we decided to do a study examining gender and hair length. We might find that, on average, women have longer hair than men. However, having long hair doesnt make you female and being female doesnt give you long hair. In other words, females have longer hair on average, but this logic cannot be applied to individuals.</p><p>If you are surprised by your results on any of these tests, you shouldnt be concerned. There are many reasons why scores on this task might differ. For instance, differences in computer systems or distractions while doing the task can affect results. This task was not designed to specifically assess you, and the scores can vary widely among the people who complete it.</p>...<p>In this test, you had to respond as quickly as possible to images on your screen. Your score is your speed or how fast you were able to respond. Higher scores indicate faster responses.</p>...<p>In this test, you were asked to correctly match pairs of shapes and numbers. Your score indicates how many pairs you were able to match in 90 seconds.
